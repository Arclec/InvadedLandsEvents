# InvadedLandsEvents
This plugin is intended to be a remake of the InvadedLands events.
It is no where near done and is in no way ready to be built for stable releases.

## Things that are in development:
- All the events
- Party functionality (The commands for parties are done but they wont affect the events yet)
- Configurable messages
- Event leaderboards / stats
- Multiple arenas (later release)
- More coming soon

## Prerequisites
- WorldGuard
- WorldEdit (for WorldGuard)
